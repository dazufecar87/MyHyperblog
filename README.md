# My Hyperblog ðŸ˜‰

This repository is part of my practice doing the Git and GitHub course on Platzi, this contains the elements listed below:

- a basic html webpage using css (**blogpost.html**).
- a plain text file (**historia.html**).
- a .gitignore file.
- a readme.md.
- apart from creating these files, I had the chance to apply git commands, use my local and remote repositories, as well as fork repositories from others.
- from this course I learned the general flow of projects using git and gitHub.

In this course I have used WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and vscode.

This course has strengthen my git and github skills overall.
